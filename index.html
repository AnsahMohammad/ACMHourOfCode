            <p style="font-size:25px; display:inline-block; width:1250px;">WHO/Europe provides a broad range of resources to support preparedness for and response to heat-waves. WHO/Europes annual #KeepCool campaign includes 
                short informational videos for use on social media and information factsheets translated into many of the languages of the Region. They aim to increase
                 heathealth advocacy and strengthen capacity to act effectively before, during and after hot weather to protect the public and reduce the burden on health systems.</p>
